# DadCast: When you're New Balances just aren't white enough.

Dadcast is a new project where I can better develop my full-stack clojure skills. I also think it's a dope name for a podcast, so you can look out for it in the apple podcast store within the next 5 to 10 business years.

### What the project does and why it is useful: 

Not quite sure at the moment. Twitter clones are always a good place to start, but this could also just be a silly website. It usefulness is not for the user currently, it's just for me.

### Getting Started

##### Prerequisites: 
1. Knowledge of clojure syntax
   - If you are not familiar, I suggest reading **_AND CODING_** through chapters 3-5 of 
     [Clojure for the Brave and True](https://www.braveclojure.com/do-things/). The rest of the chapters are important      and you will need to go back and give them a whack, but those three chapter will get you the basics of the            language (syntax). Read through it about three to four times to really get the hang of it.

##### Tools:
1. Clojurescript/Reagent 
   - If not familiar, once you have set up the project, walk through [this tut](https://reagent-project.github.io/) a      couple of times to get used to it.
2. Shadow-cljs
   -As tempted as I am to make you read through [Shadow CLJS User's Guide](https://shadow-cljs.github.io/docs/UsersGuide.html#_deps_edn_tools_deps), everything you need to get up and running can be found in [this repo](https://github.com/thheller/shadow-cljs). Highly suggest struggling through the user's guide. As a wise friend once told me:
   > Shadow is a general purpose build tool. The user guide will tell you how to swing a hammer, it won't tell you how to build your particular house.But the more you know the tools, the easier it'll be to build a product.
   These are the things needed to before we start.
   
##### Actually Getting Started:
I unfortunately need to leave this as is right now and head off to work. Hopefully will find time to finish later today and add the steps to get my set up the way I want.
